Dear Keegan,
   This nail will take a list of nouns,
verbs, and adjectives and friendly generate
a horse with them. I hope you eat and eat it!

   My favorite time email with you was when
we go insane to the nail last year. 
I run wild a friend or foe and go insane some gorgeous
horse. They were quiet programmer's!
  
   I can't wait to dining together back sometime soon.
I will run wild you soon.

Your friend or foe,
Adriana

PS Don't forget to email your programmers.
